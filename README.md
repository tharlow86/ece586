Final Project



Files:

  README.md - This document

  gen.py - Python script generate all required files for simulation

  sim.py - Python script that simulates processor

  finalReport.docx - The final report in Microsoft Word format

  appendix\finalDatapath.png - Datapath diagram.  Also in final report.

  appendix\pipelineTable.xlsx - Pipeline table in Microsoft Excel format. Not in report.

  input\ - Folder where generated data memory files are stored

  instruction\ - Folder where generated instruction memory and assembly files are stored

  output\ - Folder where both calculated and simulated output files are stored

  trace\ - Folder where processor trace files are stored



Instructions:

1. Run gen.py to generate all the required file
2. Run sim.py to simulate the newly generated files

NOTE: 	Currently there is no housekeeping so files must manually be deleted after simulation.
      	This is really only a problem if you run a large number of simulations then a small
      	number.  The files from the large simulation will still be in the folders and sim.py
      	will crank through them all automatically.
